This Project is made by Unreal Engine 4. 
I am using Version 4.19. 

Plan of Water elevation:
  2048 * 2048 Heightmap with moutains, ground and sea. ( chose the heightmap of Norway, might change to a U.S one)
  Build my own textures such as sand, ground, rocks, etc. Editor them as function-materials, so it could change by height changing.
  Player modeler is a FPS shooter, he can shoot the ball, and the bults can be reflected by all of the surfaces.(Might delete it later)
  A lolt of models add (trees, grass, flowers, rocks, and maybe a wooden house)
  Using some cool 
  There are 4 modes of the landscapes: frozen(winter), rain(summer), windy(fall), and normal(spring). Models will change in different mode also.
  Add the tempreture and height on UI. Both can change by the height changes. There is a formula.
