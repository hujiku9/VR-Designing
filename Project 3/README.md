Probblems:
	I can't find free high quality anatomy models online, so I bought these.
	No enough time to finish perfect. Busy on the finals.
	There is something wrong with the light. When I click to change the scenes, the models shows to be darker.
	Something wrong with the application, the camera don't work well. But it worked perfectly in the unity.


Thanks
