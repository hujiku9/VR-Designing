Versions: 
       Windows 64-bit

Screen shot:

       ¡ü This is why I choose UE4 but not Unity.
Introduction:
This is a project only made by the newest version UE4. I planned to build one map and different models for each season with some cool function materials and models. And you can¡¯t believe how expensive the UE4 tools and models are! BUT there are some Awesome things in marketplace: Zen Garden¡ªthe basic of my project.
It includes map, UI, camera, animals, water, and some models. I change it such as removing something I don¡¯t want, adding some models, changing models size. I wonder the map that Zen Garden is empty in the middle. Well I fill it somehow.
Parts:
* Small games:
o Flower open and waving in the wind(mouse)
o Play with fishes
o Draw on the sand
o Play the water fond and order butterfly
* Audios:
o Almost have audios for everything
* Cool models:
o I learned sometimes the models don¡¯t have to be 3D, two pictures can mix to a cool model.
Problems:
* FPS character won¡¯t move in a right way, but it works in another project. 
* Low memory RAM gives me a lot of trouble. Too often to stuck.  

The Project files are too big, and Github refused to upload.
